    "## Overview\n",
    "Text summarization produces a concise and fluent summary of a longer text document. There are two main text summarization types: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting critical sentences from the original text and combining them to form a summary. Abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences representing the original text's main points. In this notebook, you go through a few examples of how large language models can help with generating summaries based on text.\n",

I got a medium, and it goes just below my waist, and I\\'m short at 4\\'10”. The material is soft, almost slightly fuzzy, but I can see this pilling quickly. The buttons are nice but not easy to unbutton (I undid the top two and then slipped this over my head). This would be cute with flared jeans or dress pants for work. All in all, a cute sweater that I pray lasts more than one season.\\\"\n",
    "review3: \\\"Chic look for a great price. Super lightweight, mostly cotton, and is a little on the boxy side so it runs big. I\\'m usually an XL but the L fits well. I would have preferred if it was more tailored but it\\'s cute nonetheless. The gold buttons are a great addition but are hard to open/close - not a big deal to me but it\\'s worth noting.

I got a medium, and it goes just below my waist, and I\\'m short at 4\\'10”. The material is soft, almost slightly fuzzy, but I can see this pilling quickly. The buttons are nice but not easy to unbutton (I undid the top two and then slipped this over my head). This would be cute with flared jeans or dress pants for work. All in all, a cute sweater that I pray lasts more than one season.\\\"\n",
